                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>In the dormant stage, the "Peeper" looks no different from an ordinary monitor. But when it wakes up, its four mechanical arms will open up and rotate around it. Its red electronic eyes will move around to quietly observe everything around it.</p>

                Even now, we still haven't figure out what caused the "Peeper" to appear. All we know is that one day in July 2024, an employee of our life sciences lab accidentally spotted the creature in the place where the monitor had been.
                Considering its appearance and the way it moves, we can reasonably infer that this creature most likely evolved from a monitor.
                Overall, the "Peeper" is a very shy but curious creature. It likes to sneak up behind you and watch your movements, but it will get nervous and go on alert when you move too fast.
                So remember to keep your movements gentle and slow!

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature?</span> 
                The "Peeper" will constantly trace the speed of your mouse. When you keep the mouse still, it will show its original appearance and move around.
                When you move slowly, it will go back to the center and pretend to be a normal monitor.
                When you move really fast, it will get alert.
