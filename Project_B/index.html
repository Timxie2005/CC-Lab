            <p>The telegraph machine was invented by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the 1830s.</p>
            <p>It was a device that used electrical signals to transmit messages over vast distances via wires.</p>
            <p>To make this transmission of information possible, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail developed Morse code, a system of encoding textual information into sequences of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals).</p>
            <p>They were the pioneers of long-distance communication technology, paving the way for the development of the telephone, radio, and eventually the internet.</p>
